/*:
## Barrier
Generalize the rendezvous solution. Every thread should run the following code:
```
    rendezvous
    critical point
```
The synchronization requirement is that no thread executes critical point until after all threads have executed rendezvous.
You can assume that there are n threads and that this value is stored in a variable, n, that is accessible from all threads.
When the first n âˆ’ 1 threads arrive they should block until the nth thread arrives, at which point all the threads may proceed.
